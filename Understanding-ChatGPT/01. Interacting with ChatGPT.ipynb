This means that ChatGPT has a wide range of potential applications.\n",

Using our own expertise, we can then verify and finalize the responses. This workflow of AI doing the legwork and a human providing the finishing touches saves a substantial amount of time and money. Take the example of using ChatGPT to generate marketing content: this will allow marketers to focus on more complex and nuanced tasks, such as deciding what to market and to whom. Implementing ChatGPT into products will also allow for greater personalization of content, delivering more value to customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's text-generation capabilities come from a large language model, or LLM, which sits at the heart of the application.

    "This leads us to our first limitation: ChatGPT was trained on data up to a certain date, which differs depending on the model used.

One common ChatGPT use case is asking it to summarize a passage of text. In the prompt, we should specify roughly how long we want the resulting summary to be: one page, one paragraph, or even one sentence. Second, keep prompts concise. This means removing any unnecessary information or linguistic frills that don't provide extra context for the task at hand - these extras will only dilute the important information and keywords.

In many cases, this is a much quicker way of providing extra context than writing a comprehensive explanation of the desired results. For example, let's use ChatGPT to create a list of example customer names, ages, and occupations that we can use to test our internal systems. We want the results in a very specific format: the full name and age separated by a comma, followed by the occupation in brackets. We should provide an example in the prompt so ChatGPT understands exactly what we're asking for.\n",
