    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:17 - 00:46\n",
    "\n",
    "traditional chatbot, but ChatGPT is much more than that. Traditional chatbots were usually designed to return a predetermined response to a limited number of questions. ChatGPT is far more generalizable, as it uses its understanding of language to interpret the question or task and determine the most appropriate response. This means that ChatGPT has a wide range of potential applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Generative AI\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:46 - 01:03\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT uses generative AI to respond to users. Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, where a model creates new content based on patterns in information it has already seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. From prompt to response\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:03 - 01:11\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how ChatGPT works: the user writes a question or instruction, which is more generally called a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. From prompt to response\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:11 - 01:23\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt is passed as an input to the application, which uses its understanding of language to interpret the prompt and generate new, relevant language in response to it.\n",

    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:23 - 01:31\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the response is returned to the user. Let's see ChatGPT in action with some examples!\n",

    "8\\. Summarizing text\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:31 - 01:45\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is great at summarizing text or explaining concepts for a particular audience, which is useful when summarizing reports for different stakeholders or interpreting complex information.\n",

    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:52 - 02:09\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT responds with a summary that contains very few technical details or jargon while still capturing the key points. This is a good start; however, the summary is quite long. It would be better if we could boil it down to two key sentences.\n",

    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:13 - 02:36\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we don't have to instruct it to summarize generative AI again; ChatGPT will actually remember the information and context from earlier in the conversation. The ability to remember the conversation history, and for the user to provide follow-up corrections to responses, are two of ChatGPT's most powerful capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "13\\. Creating marketing content\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:36 - 02:53\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing text or concepts is pretty cool, but ChatGPT can also perform more creative tasks, such as creating marketing content. Let's ask ChatGPT to write a tweet encouraging people to acquire data literacy skills.\n",

    "14\\. Creating marketing content\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:53 - 03:23\n",
    "\n",
    "This tweet is pretty good: ChatGPT came up with a catchy slogan (Unlock the power of data!), considered X's character limit, and utilized relevant hashtags and emojis to improve audience engagement. ChatGPT is already being applied to streamline many different marketing tasks, including creating email templates, writing blog post titles and descriptions, and copyediting large bodies of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "15\\. Generating and debugging code\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:23 - 03:40\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is also impacting how software engineers, data practitioners, and others write code. ChatGPT is able to generate template code, explain why code isn't working, and even make suggestions for improvements!\n",
    "\n",
    "16\\. Why utilize ChatGPT?\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:40 - 04:30\n",
    "\n",
    "So why should we begin implementing ChatGPT into our workflows and business processes? ChatGPT is able to perform many time-consuming tasks with greater efficiency. Using our own expertise, we can then verify and finalize the responses. This workflow of AI doing the legwork and a human providing the finishing touches saves a substantial amount of time and money. Take the example of using ChatGPT to generate marketing content: this will allow marketers to focus on more complex and nuanced tasks, such as deciding what to market and to whom. Implementing ChatGPT into products will also allow for greater personalization of content, delivering more value to customers.\n",
