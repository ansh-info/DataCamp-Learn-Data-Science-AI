    "traditional chatbot, but ChatGPT is much more than that. Traditional chatbots were usually designed to return a predetermined response to a limited number of questions. ChatGPT is far more generalizable, as it uses its understanding of language to interpret the question or task and determine the most appropriate response. This means that ChatGPT has a wide range of potential applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Generative AI\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:46 - 01:03\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT uses generative AI to respond to users. Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, where a model creates new content based on patterns in information it has already seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. From prompt to response\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:03 - 01:11\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how ChatGPT works: the user writes a question or instruction, which is more generally called a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. From prompt to response\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:11 - 01:23\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt is passed as an input to the application, which uses its understanding of language to interpret the prompt and generate new, relevant language in response to it.\n",

    "--------------------\n",

    "01:31 - 01:45\n",

    "Notice that we don't have to instruct it to summarize generative AI again; ChatGPT will actually remember the information and context from earlier in the conversation. The ability to remember the conversation history, and for the user to provide follow-up corrections to responses, are two of ChatGPT's most powerful capabilities.\n",

    "13\\. Creating marketing content\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:36 - 02:53\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing text or concepts is pretty cool, but ChatGPT can also perform more creative tasks, such as creating marketing content. Let's ask ChatGPT to write a tweet encouraging people to acquire data literacy skills.\n",

    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:53 - 03:23\n",
    "\n",
    "This tweet is pretty good: ChatGPT came up with a catchy slogan (Unlock the power of data!), considered X's character limit, and utilized relevant hashtags and emojis to improve audience engagement. ChatGPT is already being applied to streamline many different marketing tasks, including creating email templates, writing blog post titles and descriptions, and copyediting large bodies of text.\n",

    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So why should we begin implementing ChatGPT into our workflows and business processes? ChatGPT is able to perform many time-consuming tasks with greater efficiency. Using our own expertise, we can then verify and finalize the responses. This workflow of AI doing the legwork and a human providing the finishing touches saves a substantial amount of time and money. Take the example of using ChatGPT to generate marketing content: this will allow marketers to focus on more complex and nuanced tasks, such as deciding what to market and to whom. Implementing ChatGPT into products will also allow for greater personalization of content, delivering more value to customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's text-generation capabilities come from a large language model, or LLM, which sits at the heart of the application. The LLM interprets the prompt and generates relevant text in response based on its understanding of language. To understand some of the limitations of ChatGPT, we'll first need to delve a little deeper into how the LLM works.\n",

    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:52 - 02:17\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to our first limitation: ChatGPT was trained on data up to a certain date, which differs depending on the model used. Without being directly provided with additional context, these models will have no knowledge of events past these dates. As OpenAI updates the LLMs used in ChatGPT, these dates will continue to shift forward.\n",

    "Another common issue when interacting with ChatGPT is hallucination, which is when the model confidently tells us inaccurate information.
