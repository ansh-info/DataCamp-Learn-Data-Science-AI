This course is intended for people with basic knowledge about Python and familiarity with statistics. At the end of the course you'll have an understanding of basic probability concepts like random variables, calculations, probability distributions, and important results like the law of large numbers.

In this case the experiment is the flip of a coin; the possible outcomes are success (getting heads) or failure (getting tails). Each outcome is called an event. You assign probabilities to events.
