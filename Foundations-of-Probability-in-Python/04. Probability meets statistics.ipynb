    "Jakob Bernoulli developed the law of large numbers in his book Ars Conjectandi (1713). The law states that the sample mean tends to the expected value as the sample grows larger.\n",

    "To generate a sample of coin flips, we will use the binomial distribution. First we import the binom object and the describe method from scipy dot stats, then we generate the sample using binom dot rvs. We specify n as 1 coin flip and p as the probability of success (0.5 for a fair coin), then we specify the sample size as 250 and set random_state so we can reproduce our results. After that, we print the first 100 values from our samples.\n",

    "In this animation you see how we take the sample mean for values from 2 to 250 using the describe method. The red line represents the population mean, in this case 0.5, and the blue line is the sample mean. As you'll notice, due to the randomness of the data, the sample mean fluctuates around the population mean -- but as more data becomes available, the sample mean approaches the population mean. Let's see another example with the normal distribution.\n",

    "Now we have three animated plots. At the top left we have our sample data from a normal distribution. We use one dot for each sample. At the top right we've plotted a histogram of the sample data, and at the bottom we've plotted the sample mean. In all the plots the population mean is represented with a black line and the sample mean is drawn using a red line. You can see how the red line moves and gets nearer to the population mean as more data becomes available. Enjoy the animations for a bit, and get some perspective. Now let's move on and learn how to plot the sample mean with Python.\n",
