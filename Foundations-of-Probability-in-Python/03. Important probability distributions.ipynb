    "\n",
    "00:10 - 00:28\n",

    "Normal distributions, also called Gaussian distributions after mathematician Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, allow you to model many situations. For instance, you can use them to model different measures like clothing sizes, speed measures or product weights.\n",

    "Let's look at an example. The heights of adults aged between 18 and 35 years are normally distributed. The mean height of adult males in this age group is 70 inches. Adult females have a mean height of 65 inches. You can see the probability density in the plot. Let's take a look at how this works.\n",

    "4\\. Probability density\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:54 - 01:13\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density is a function that assigns the relative likelihood to each possible outcome in the sample space. In normal distributions, the probability density has a bell shape. The plot is dense and symmetric around the mean.\n",

    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:13 - 01:49\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the plot on the left you can see that the probability density of getting -1 is roughly 0.24. On the other hand, the probability density of getting 0 is 0.4, as seen in the plot on the right. You can compare the probability densities for different values of the random variable to determine which is more likely. In this case, 0 is more likely than -1. But what would the probability of getting a value between -1 and 0 be?\n",
