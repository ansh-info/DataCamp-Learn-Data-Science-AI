Adult females have a mean height of 65 inches. You can see the probability density in the plot. Let's take a look at how this works.\n",

    "For instance, in the plot on the left you can see that the probability density of getting -1 is roughly 0.24. On the other hand, the probability density of getting 0 is 0.4, as seen in the plot on the right. You can compare the probability densities for different values of the random variable to determine which is more likely. In this case, 0 is more likely than -1. But what would the probability of getting a value between -1 and 0 be?\n",
