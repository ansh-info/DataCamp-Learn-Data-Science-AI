In this chapter, you're going to be putting everything you've learned together by building a proof of concept spoken language processing pipeline. Acme Studios, a technology company, has approached you to use your speech processing skills to gain insights on their customer support calls. They've sent you a handful of audio samples to explore and to see what you can find. They let you know they're not quite sure of the quality of the files or the format they're recorded in.\n",
