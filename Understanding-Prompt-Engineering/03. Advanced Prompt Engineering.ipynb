    "1\\. Training techniques\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:03\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to our journey with ChatGPT!\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Introduction to training techniques\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:03 - 00:26\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of your interactions lie training techniques. These determine the way the model generates answers. It's crucial to understand the spectrum of zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning. These aren't just cool names. They represent the degree of examples or context we provide ChatGPT before asking our main question. Let's explore these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Zero-shot learning\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:26 - 00:46\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot learning is when we throw a question or task at ChatGPT without providing any prior examples. It's like asking someone to dive into the deep end without any practice. But sometimes, diving right in works! For example, let's ask ChatGPT to write a poem about the tranquility of mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Zero-shot learning\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:46 - 01:04\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the model relies on its extensive pre-training, leveraging the multitude of patterns it has learned to generate a response that fits the prompt. Zero-shot learning showcases the power of language models to respond in novel situations without the need for prior examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. One-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:04 - 01:22\n",
    "\n",
    "One-shot is the middle ground. Think of it as showing someone how to do a task once and then expecting them to replicate it. We give ChatGPT one example to guide its response, showing that London is the capital of the UK. Then we ask what is the capital of Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. One-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:22 - 01:31\n",
    "\n",
    "One-shot learning is an echo of human learning, where one example can serve as a powerful template for understanding and action.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. Few-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:31 - 01:47\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning is where we arm ChatGPT with multiple examples before posing our main query. Here, we ask for the capital of Australia, whilst learning the formatting of placing the country's flag after the capital city.\n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. Few-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:47 - 01:59\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example serves as a building block, creating a more nuanced understanding within ChatGPT. We're essentially training the model on the fly, giving it a richer context to grasp the essence of our queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "9\\. Pattern matching and recognition\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:59 - 02:25\n",
    "\n",
    "One fascinating aspect of few-shot learning is that ChatGPT becomes more than just an autocomplete tool. It turns into a pattern-matching and pattern-generation engine. ChatGPT understands the structure of the information and generates new content based on recognized patterns you provide. Number one, it starts by analyzing the examples. It then mirrors the underlying patterns. Then finally it creates new ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "10\\. Pattern matching and recognition\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:25 - 02:53\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibilities for few-shot learning are endless. You can feed ChatGPT examples of: your writing style to help construct email replies; also, formatting preferences for reports to ensure consistency across documents; and finally, decision-making frameworks to generate new approaches to problems. Few-shot learning provides the opportunity for ChatGPT to extend beyond a mere respondent and become an extension of our mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "11\\. Chain of thought (COT) prompting\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:53 - 03:11\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Thought Prompting (COT) is an advanced technique that takes training a step further. Here, we're not just giving examples but a roadmap of how to arrive at the answer. It mirrors the way we are, as humans, approach problem-solving: by breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "12\\. Zero-shot COT\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:11 - 03:20\n",
    "\n",
    "With zero-shot COT, we provide a situation: travelling to space and encountering aliens. We ask ChatGPT to \"think step by step.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "13\\. Zero-shot COT\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:20 - 03:37\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a thoughtful breakdown where ChatGPT reasons through the encounters. By prompting ChatGPT to reveal its reasoning, we gain insights into the model's thought process, allowing us to better understand, verify and trust its conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "14\\. One-shot COT\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:37 - 03:48\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we provide an example using one-shot training, we can teach the model how to approach a particular type of problem. It learns the steps and considerations necessary to reach a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "15\\. One-shot COT\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:48 - 04:01\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, ChatGPT only acknowledges the number of astronauts you had a direct interaction with. This can help prevent errors that might occur if it were to jump directly to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "16\\. Let's practice!\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "04:01 - 04:30\n",
    "\n",
    "Training techniques aren't just about getting an answer; they're about shaping that answer. Whether you're using Zero-shot for a quick reply, One-shot for guided responses, Few-shot for pattern-driven answers, or COT for methodical solutions, you're in the director's chair, shaping the narrative of ChatGPT's responses. Dive into the exercises and see how different training techniques can dramatically alter the output."
