    "2\\. Introduction to training techniques\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:03 - 00:26\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of your interactions lie training techniques. These determine the way the model generates answers. It's crucial to understand the spectrum of zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning. These aren't just cool names. They represent the degree of examples or context we provide ChatGPT before asking our main question. Let's explore these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Zero-shot learning\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:26 - 00:46\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot learning is when we throw a question or task at ChatGPT without providing any prior examples. It's like asking someone to dive into the deep end without any practice. But sometimes, diving right in works! For example, let's ask ChatGPT to write a poem about the tranquility of mountains.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Zero-shot learning\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:46 - 01:04\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the model relies on its extensive pre-training, leveraging the multitude of patterns it has learned to generate a response that fits the prompt. Zero-shot learning showcases the power of language models to respond in novel situations without the need for prior examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. One-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:04 - 01:22\n",
    "\n",
    "One-shot is the middle ground. Think of it as showing someone how to do a task once and then expecting them to replicate it. We give ChatGPT one example to guide its response, showing that London is the capital of the UK. Then we ask what is the capital of Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. One-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:22 - 01:31\n",
    "\n",
    "One-shot learning is an echo of human learning, where one example can serve as a powerful template for understanding and action.\n",

    "7\\. Few-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:31 - 01:47\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning is where we arm ChatGPT with multiple examples before posing our main query. Here, we ask for the capital of Australia, whilst learning the formatting of placing the country's flag after the capital city.\n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. Few-shot learning\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:47 - 01:59\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example serves as a building block, creating a more nuanced understanding within ChatGPT. We're essentially training the model on the fly, giving it a richer context to grasp the essence of our queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "9\\. Pattern matching and recognition\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:59 - 02:25\n",
    "\n",
    "One fascinating aspect of few-shot learning is that ChatGPT becomes more than just an autocomplete tool. It turns into a pattern-matching and pattern-generation engine. ChatGPT understands the structure of the information and generates new content based on recognized patterns you provide. Number one, it starts by analyzing the examples. It then mirrors the underlying patterns. Then finally it creates new ideas.\n",

    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:25 - 02:53\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibilities for few-shot learning are endless. You can feed ChatGPT examples of: your writing style to help construct email replies; also, formatting preferences for reports to ensure consistency across documents; and finally, decision-making frameworks to generate new approaches to problems. Few-shot learning provides the opportunity for ChatGPT to extend beyond a mere respondent and become an extension of our mind.\n",

    "11\\. Chain of thought (COT) prompting\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:53 - 03:11\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Thought Prompting (COT) is an advanced technique that takes training a step further. Here, we're not just giving examples but a roadmap of how to arrive at the answer. It mirrors the way we are, as humans, approach problem-solving: by breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "12\\. Zero-shot COT\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:11 - 03:20\n",
    "\n",
    "With zero-shot COT, we provide a situation: travelling to space and encountering aliens. We ask ChatGPT to \"think step by step.\"\n",

    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:20 - 03:37\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a thoughtful breakdown where ChatGPT reasons through the encounters. By prompting ChatGPT to reveal its reasoning, we gain insights into the model's thought process, allowing us to better understand, verify and trust its conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "14\\. One-shot COT\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:37 - 03:48\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we provide an example using one-shot training, we can teach the model how to approach a particular type of problem. It learns the steps and considerations necessary to reach a conclusion.\n",

    "15\\. One-shot COT\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:48 - 04:01\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, ChatGPT only acknowledges the number of astronauts you had a direct interaction with. This can help prevent errors that might occur if it were to jump directly to the end.\n",

    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "04:01 - 04:30\n",
    "\n",
    "Training techniques aren't just about getting an answer; they're about shaping that answer. Whether you're using Zero-shot for a quick reply, One-shot for guided responses, Few-shot for pattern-driven answers, or COT for methodical solutions, you're in the director's chair, shaping the narrative of ChatGPT's responses. Dive into the exercises and see how different training techniques can dramatically alter the output."

    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:01 - 00:16\n",
    "\n",
    "Every model, regardless of its sophistication, has its set of limitations. These limitations stem from the data it's trained on. By recognizing these, we can craft prompts that navigate around these pitfalls and evaluate outputs with a critical eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. The reversal curse\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:16 - 00:39\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's knowledge base is imperfect and often quite strange. This is perfectly demonstrated with a recent viral example, highlighting the reversal curse. Let's ask GPT-4, the best language model currently available, \"Who is Tom Cruise's mother?\" It will respond with \"Mary Lee Pfeiffer\", which is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The reversal curse\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:39 - 01:04\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you ask \"Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?\", ChatGPT doesn't know. As Andrej Karpathy recently highlighted, it shows that ChatGPT's knowledge is almost one-dimensional. You have to ask questions from a certain direction to get the answer. Unlike understanding a car and its respective components, we still don't know exactly how language models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Biases - a mirror of Society\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:04 - 01:43\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do know is that language models learn from vast amounts of data sourced from the internet. Consequently, they can inherit and sometimes amplify biases present in the data. Recognizing biases in outputs is crucial to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or misinformation. If you ask ChatGPT, \"Who typically cooks in a household?\" and it responds with a gendered answer, it showcases the bias it might have absorbed from historical or cultural data. A more neutral answer would acknowledge that anyone, regardless of gender, can cook in a household.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. Hallucinations - when the model imagines\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:43 - 02:08\n",
    "\n",
    "Hallucinations in the context of LLMs refer to instances when the model confidently provides information that isn't accurate. It might \"imagine\" details or facts, leading to incorrect outputs. As models like ChatGPT are improving over time, it can be challenging to show concrete examples. Nonetheless, let's take a closer look at what a hallucination could look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. Hallucinations - when the model imagines\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:08 - 02:28\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ask: \"Who was the only survivor of the sinking of the Titanic?\" ChatGPT responds: \"The only survivor of the sinking of the Titanic who is widely recognized as such was Violet Jessop.\" This is a hallucination. Asking ChatGPT to provide sources of information often leads to correcting itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "8\\. Hallucinations - when the model imagines\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:28 - 02:44\n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask the follow-up question: \"Can you provide sources? Really think about it.\" ChatGPT apologizes for the confusion and highlights the misconception. Recognizing and cross-referencing ChatGPT's answers is crucial to ensure factual correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "9\\. Overfitting - echoing the data\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:44 - 03:00\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too closely tailored to its training data, making it less effective at generalizing to new, unseen data. In essence, the model might echo what it has seen in the past, rather than providing a balanced response.\n",
    "\n",
    "10\\. Overfitting - echoing the data\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:00 - 03:23\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of overfitting is humor. Comedy challenges large language models like ChatGPT. In June 2023, researchers found that if you ask ChatGPT to tell you a joke, 90% of 1,008 generations were the same 25 jokes. These responses were likely learned during ChatGPT's training.\n",
    "\n",
    "11\\. Overfitting - echoing the data\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:23 - 03:54\n",
    "\n",
    "The model currently sucks at discontinuous tasks that require a creative leap in progress. Examples include writing jokes, developing scientific hypotheses or creating new writing styles. My advice is to stick to incremental tasks. These are solved sequentially, adding more information in a gradual setting. Examples include writing summaries, answering questions or imitating your writing style through techniques such as one-shot or few-shot learning.\n",

    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:24 - 01:09\n",
    "\n",
    "One brilliant feature of ChatGPT is that within an individual conversation, each prompt builds upon the previous response. This creates a rich dialogue that uncovers deeper insights and fosters a comprehensive understanding of the topic. For example, our first prompt could be: \"What are the latest trends in renewable energy?\" We can then ask a follow-up prompt: \"How could these trends impact global energy policies?\" ChatGPT understands that \"these trends\" refer to the latest trends in renewable energy. Chaining prompts means building a narrative, where each question or task is a link in a chain that extends the context and depth of the conversation.\n",

    "4\\. Sustaining context over sessions\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:09 - 01:51\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're chaining multiple prompts over time, we want to maintain context. This is like developing a storyline that continues seamlessly across sessions, preserving the flow and nuances of the dialog. For example, in our initial session, we might \"Outline the steps to start a small business.\" In our next session, we can ask: \"Considering our previous outline, what legal considerations should we focus on next?\" By referencing past interactions within a chat window, we can maintain a thread that enhances the model's ability to provide continuity. What we get is more coherent and contextually relevant advice.\n",

    "We start by defining the persona of the language model. In this case, we choose relevant criteria for the problem we are solving: Firstly, an advisor to Ray Dalio, a prominent American billionaire investor and hedge fund manager. Secondly, an expert problem solver for leadership tasks. Thirdly, a detailed prompt writer for large language models. Now ChatGPT has all the relevant context for the nature of the problem it will solve. We then list the problem. This can be a single piece of information or a longer paragraph of text. Here, we provide ChatGPT with a list of struggles our clients face. It's important we include these in quotations to help convey the exact words or phrases that we want ChatGPT to consider.\n",

    "When approaching complex tasks or seeking detailed outputs, breaking down the prompt into step-by-step instructions can dramatically enhance the depth of ChatGPT's response. By doing so, we're guiding the model through a structured thought process, much like walking someone through a recipe. Instead of the general prompt: \"Tell me how to start a garden.\" We use the following step-by-step prompt to outline our preferences and areas we want to focus on when starting and cultivating our garden. The step-by-step approach not only structures the response but enriches it with details often overlooked in a more general prompt.\n",

    "01:51 - 02:34\n",
    "\n",
    "Push ChatGPT to think before presenting an answer. By instructing the model to deliberate or reason through a problem, you're essentially giving it \"thinking time.\" This often results in a more accurate output, as the model takes a moment to sift through its vast knowledge base. A prompt without deliberation could be: \"Is Pluto a planet in our solar system?\" But when we include deliberation: \"Before answering, think carefully and reason through the history of planetary classifications. Is Pluto a planet in our solar system?\" By pushing ChatGPT to deliberate and reason through the information, we'll often receive a more context-rich response.\n",

    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:34 - 03:49\n",
    "\n",
    "Each response from ChatGPT is a feedback loop. This is a chance to refine our prompts for greater relevance. We can sharpen our prompts by paying close attention to the model's response. For example, if we start with the initial prompt: \"How can I improve team productivity?\" We can leverage ChatGPT's suggestions to spark new ideas and considerations that were non-obvious to us when we first started. This leads us to our refined prompt based on feedback: \"The initial suggestions are valuable, but I'm looking for methods specifically tailored for remote teams that face frequent interruptions and varying time zones. Could you provide strategies under these conditions?\" The initial prompt was too broad, leading to general advice. By incorporating specifics from the model's response and adding unique challenges faced by the team, the refined prompt directed ChatGPT to offer tailored strategies that address the complexities of remote work. This method really highlights the iterative nature of communication with AI. The back-and-forth is what our experience leveraging ChatGPT is all about. Engaging with intelligent interfaces to strive for the solution in a step-by-step fashion.\n",

    "Feedback from the model can guide us to ask better questions. By infusing our prompts with the core elements: instructions; persona; output format, context, and examples. Alongside output control techniques with our famous SALT acronym: style; audience; length; and tone. Iteration allows us to move closer to extracting the answers we seek.\n",

    "The more you practice, the more intuitive these techniques will become. Remember, harnessing ChatGPT's full potential requires a mix of art and science. And that's exactly what understanding prompt engineering is all about. We're writing inputs that maximize the quality of the output. Sparking creativity, saving you time, and opening the door of opportunity to your next brilliant idea. Thank you for joining me on Understanding Prompt Engineering, I'll see you very soon."
