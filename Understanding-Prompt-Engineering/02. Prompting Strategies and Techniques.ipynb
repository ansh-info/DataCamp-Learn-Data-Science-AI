    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:03 - 00:25\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting a prompt is like laying the foundation for a building. It sets the stage for everything that follows. Just as a wise builder wouldn't construct their house upon the sand, we must master the art of prompt construction. We're diving deep into the architecture of prompts, understanding the intricacies of their structure, and setting the stage for meaningful interactions ahead.\n",

    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:34 - 01:09\n",
    "\n",
    "However effective prompts typically exhibit three distinct traits: Clarity: A well-defined prompt includes the relevant context to reduce ambiguity. Specificity: The more specific you are, the closer you get to your desired answer. And finally, open-endedness: Sometimes, allowing the model to think outside the box can yield richer results that were non-obvious from the outset. In this lesson, we're going one step deeper and define the five elements that can turn a good prompt into a great one. Let's explore.\n",

    "---------------------------------------\n",

    "01:09 - 01:26\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a good prompt, at least one of the following elements should be present. Make your instructions clear to reduce ambiguity. Instead of \"What is the name of the monarch?\" which assumes the country, ask \"What is the name of the current monarch in Denmark\" This narrows down the response domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "When writing prompts, adopting a persona is sometimes helpful. This can help ensure the model's output is specific, relevant and useful to the target audience. Instead of \"Write me a short story\" which is a very broad statement, ask \"You are J.K Rowling. Write me a short story about magic\". ChatGPT now adopts J.K Rowling's writing style for your short story, leading to a much higher quality output.\n",

Use my writing style demonstrated in the example email to reply to the following message: {insert email you want to respond to}.\" This is perhaps one of my favourite prompting techniques.

This means the AI model is aware of events, developments, and general knowledge that has occurred up until that specific date. Any new information that emerged after this cutoff date is not included in its training data, and therefore, ChatGPT would not be aware of or be able to provide information on these topics. This limitation can sometimes influence the accuracy of responses. However, through smart prompting, we can navigate this. For instance, if you're asking questions or retrieving data in your prompt, you can specify: \"If you don't know the answer and believe this information is after your cutoff date, specify that you don't know\". Whilst this method isn't perfect, highlighting the importance of cross-referencing data points, it can be a helpful tool to identify where ChatGPT's limitations lie.\n",

Before delving deep, let's set the stage by understanding the four cornerstones of evaluating responses. Yep, you guessed it, another acronym: LARF. But there's no joke about its importance; it stands for Logical consistency, Accuracy, Relevance and Factual correctness. This will give you the skills to critically assess the outputs you receive from ChatGPT.\n",

    "Drawbacks: The initial investment can be high. Solar energy is weather-dependent. Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Notice the inconsistency? Point 3 appears in both benefits and drawbacks. While it's true solar panels require minimal maintenance (a benefit), it shouldn't also be listed as a drawback. This lack of logical consistency shows the importance of critically evaluating responses to ensure they make logical sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "While striving for accuracy, it's crucial to be aware of ChatGPT's tendency to \"hallucinate\" at times. This means the model can confidently state an incorrect answer. Suppose you prompt ChatGPT with, \"Who was the first person to walk on the moon?\" If ChatGPT replies with, \"It was Buzz Aldrin,\" this would be inaccurate. The correct answer is Neil Armstrong, with Buzz Aldrin being the second person. Even though Aldrin did walk on the moon, the response is not factually accurate concerning the specific question. This illustrates why it's crucial to verify the factual accuracy of responses, especially when they're being used as a source of information. Always cross-reference answers with alternate resources to ensure accuracy.\n",
