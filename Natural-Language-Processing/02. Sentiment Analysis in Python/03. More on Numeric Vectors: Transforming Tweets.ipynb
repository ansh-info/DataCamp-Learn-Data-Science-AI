    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:11 - 01:00\n",
    "\n",
    "Words that occur too frequently and are not very informative are called stop words. But how do we know which words are not informative? In every language, there is a set of words that most practitioners agree are not useful and should be removed when performing a natural language processing task. For instance, in English the definite and indefinite article (the, a/an), conjunctions ('and','but','for'), propositions('on', 'in', 'at'), etc. are stop words. Secondly, depending on the context, we might want to expand the standard set of stop words. For example, in the movie reviews dataset, we might want to exclude words such as 'film', 'movie', 'cinema', etc.\n",

    "3\\. Stop words with word clouds\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:00 - 01:31\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you recall from a previous video that we built word clouds using movie reviews. Here is an example of two word clouds using the movie reviews. In the picture on the left, the stop words have not been removed. Words that pop up are 'film' and 'br', which is an indication for a line break. In the cloud on the right side, stop words have been removed and now we see words such as 'character', 'see', 'good', 'story'.\n",

    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:31 - 02:21\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we remove stop words when creating a word cloud? Let's start by reviewing how we built a word cloud. First, we import the WordCloud function from wordcloud. We also import the default list of STOPWORDS from wordcloud. To create our list of stop words, we can take a set of the default list. A set is like a list but with unique, not repeating items. We can update the set of stop words by calling update and providing a list to it. We pass our list of stopwords, called my_stopwords to the stopwords argument in the WordCloud function. Then we display it. So, the only new argument we added here is defining the list of stop words. Everything else stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Stop words with BOW\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:21 - 03:34\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing non-informative words when we are building a BOW transformation can also be very useful. This can easily be incorporated in the countvectorizer function. First, we need to import the list of default English stop words from the same feature_extraction.text package from sci-kit learn. Let's assume we want to enrich this default list with movie-specific words. To do that, we call the union function on the default list. Remember that a union of two sets A and B consists of all elements of A and all elements of B such that no elements are repeated. In our case, the union will add the new words to the list of default stop words, if that word is not already there. To use the constructed set, we specify the stop_words argument in the CountVectorizer to be equal to our defined set. Everything else stays the same and should look pretty familiar by now. One important thing to note is that using stopwords will reduce the size of the vocabulary we built using a BOW or another approach.\n",

As a reminder, in a previous video we used a list comprehension to iterate over each review of the product reviews dataset and create word tokens from each review. We can adjust our original code. If we want to retain only tokens consisting of letters, for example, we can use the .isaplha() operator in a second list comprehension. Since the result of the first list comprehension is a list of lists, we first need to iterate over the items in each inner list, filtering out those tokens that are not letters. This is what happens in the first part of the list comprehension, enclosed in the inner brackets. In the second part, we are iterating over the lists, basically saying that we want to perform this filtering across all lists in the word_tokens list. When we compare the length of the first item of word_tokens and the cleaned_tokens lists, we see that the filtering decreased the number of tokens, as we might expect.\n",

We will not cover regular expressions in depth here but, a quick reminder on the syntax. We import the re package. Then imagine we have a string #Wonderfulday and we want to extract a hash(#) followed by any letter, capital or small. One standard way to do is by calling the search function on our string, specifying the regular expression. In our case, it starts with a #, and is followed by either an upper or lower case letter. When we print the result, we see that it is a match object, showing how large the match is - in our case, the span is 2, and also the exact characters that were matched.\n",

The default pattern used matches words that consists of at least two letters or numbers (\\w) and which are separated by word boundaries (\\b). It will ignore single-lettered words, and will split words such as 'don't' and 'haven't'. If we are fine with this default pattern, we don't need to change any arguments in the CountVectorizer. If we want to change it, we can specify the token_pattern argument. If we want the vectorizer to ignore digits and other characters and only consider words of two or more letters, we can use the specified token pattern. In fact, there are multiple ways to specify this. It doesn't mean the one specified here is the only correct or best way to accomplish this. Feel free to experiment with this. Note, however, that we need to add an 'r' before the regular expression itself.\n",

    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:17\n",
    "\n",
    "In a language, words are often derived from other words, meaning words can share the same root. When we create a numeric transformation of a text feature, we might want to strip a word down to its root. This is the topic of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. What is stemming?\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:17 - 00:53\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called stemming. More formally, stemming can be defined as the transformation of words to their root forms, even if the stem itself is not a valid word in the language. For example, staying, stays, stayed will be mapped to the root 'stay', and house, houses, housing will be mapped to the root 'hous'. In general, stemming will tend to chop off suffixes such as '-ed', '-ing', '-er', as well as plural or possessive forms.\n",
    "\n",

    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:53 - 01:15\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is quite a similar process to stemming, with the main difference that with lemmatization, the resulting roots are valid words in the language. Going back to our examples of words derived from 'stay', lemmatization reduces them to 'stay'; and words derived from 'house' are reduced to the noun 'house'.\n",

    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:15 - 02:02\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder when to use stemming and when lemmatization. The main difference is in the obtained roots. With lemmatization they are actual words and with stemming they might not be. So if in your problem it's important to retain words, not only roots, lemmatization would be more suitable. However, if you use nltk - which is what we will use in this course - stemming follows an algorithm which makes it faster than the lemmatization process in nltk. Furthermore, lemmatization is dependent on knowing the part of speech of the word you want to lemmatize. For example, whether we want to transform a noun, a verb, an adjective, etc.\n",

    "5\\. Stemming of strings\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:02 - 02:31\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular stemming library is the PorterStemmer in the nltk.stem package. The PorterStemmer is not the only stemmer in nltk but it's quite fast and easy to use, so it's often a standard choice. We call the PorterStemmer function and store it under the name porter. We can then call porter.stem on a string, for example, 'wonderful'. The result is 'wonder'.\n",

    "------------------------\n",

    "Stemming is possible using other languages as well, such as Danish, Dutch, French, Spanish, German, etc. To use foreign language stemmers we need to use the SnowballStemmer package. We can specify in the stemmer the foreign language we want to use. Then we apply the stem function on our string. For example, we have imported a Dutch stemmer and fed it a Dutch verb. The result is the root of the verb.\n",

    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:01 - 03:30\n",
    "\n",
    "If you apply the PorterStemmer on a sentence, the result is the original sentence. We see nothing has changed about our 'Today is a wonderful day!' sentence. We need to stem each word in the sentence separately. Therefore, as a first step, we need to transform the sentence into tokens using the familiar word_tokenize function. In the second step, we apply the stemming function on each word of the sentence, using a list comprehension.\n",

    "The lemmatization of strings is similar to stemming. We import the WordNetLemmatizer from the nltk.stem library. It uses the WordNet database to look up lemmas of words. We call the WordNetLemmatizer function and store it under the name WNlemmatizer. We can then call WNlemmatizer.lemmatize() on 'wonderful'. Note that we have specified a part-of-speech, given by the 'pos' argument. The default pos is noun, or 'n'. Here we specify an adjective, that's why pos = 'a'. The result is 'wonderful'. If you'd recall, stemming returned 'wonder' as a result.\n",
