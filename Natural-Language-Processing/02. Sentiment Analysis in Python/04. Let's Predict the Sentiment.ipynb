    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:07 - 00:42\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are working with the product reviews. A supervised learning task will try to classify any new review as either positive or negative based on already labeled reviews. This is what we call a classification problem. In the case of the product and movie reviews, we have two classes - positive and negative. This is a binary classification problem. The airline sentiment Twitter data has three categories of sentiment: positive, neutral and negative. This is a multi-class classification problem.\n",

    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:42 - 01:12\n",
    "\n",
    "One algorithm commonly applied in classification tasks is a logistic regression. You might be familiar with a linear regression, where we fit a straight line to approximate a relationship, shown in the graph on the left. With a logistic regression, instead of fitting a line, we are fitting an S-shaped curve, called a sigmoid function. A property of this function is that for any value of x, y will be between 0 and 1.\n",

    "4\\. Logistic function\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:12 - 01:49\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing linear regression, we are predicting a numeric outcome (say the sale price of a house). With logistic regression, we estimate the probability that the outcome (sentiment) belongs to a particular category(positive or negative) given the review. Since we are estimating a probability and want an output between 0 and 1, we model the X values using the sigmoid/logistic function, as shown on the graph. For more details on logistic regression, refer to other courses on DataCamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Logistic regression in Python\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:49 - 02:31\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we import the LogisticRegression from the sklearn.linear_model library. Keep in mind that the sklearn API works only with continuous variables. It also requires either a DataFrame or an array as arguments and cannot handle missing data. Therefore, all transformation of the data needs to be completed beforehand. We call the logistic regression function and create a Logistic classifier object. We fit it by specifying the X matrix, which is an numpy array of our features or a pandas DataFrame, and the vector of targets y.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. Measuring model performance\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:31 - 03:15\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know if the model is any good? We look at the discrepancy between the predicted label and what was the real label for each instance (observation) in our dataset. One common metric to use is the accuracy score. Though not appropriate in all contexts, it is still useful. Accuracy gives us the fraction of predictions that our model got right. The higher and closer it is to 1, the better. One way we can calculate the accuracy score of a logistic regression model is by calling the score method on the logistic regression object. It takes as arguments the X matrix and y vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\\. Using accuracy score\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:15 - 04:02\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics. There is an accuracy_score function apart from the score function because different models have different default score metrics. Thus, the accuracy_score function always returns the accuracy but the score function might return other metrics if we use it to evaluate other models. Here, we need to explicitly calculate the predictions of the model, by calling predict on the matrix of features. The accuracy score takes as arguments the vector of true labels and the predicted labels. We see in the case of logistic regression, both score and accuracy score return value of 0.9009.\n",

    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:17 - 00:54\n",
    "\n",
    "To get any idea on how well a model will perform on unseen data, we randomly split the dataset in 2 parts: one used for training (building the model) and one for testing (evaluate the performance of the model). In some cases, when we want to tune the parameters of our algorithm, we might have 3 sets: training, testing and validation, but this is out of scope for our course. The training set is usually around 70 or 80% of the whole dataset, and the rest is used for testing.\n",

    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:54 - 01:59\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can perform a random train-test split using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection package. It takes as arguments arrays, lists, or DataFrames. The X-train and test matrices and y-train and test vectors are the output of the train_test_split. The first arguments we provide in the function are the features matrix X and labels vector y. We can specify the proportion of the data going to testing; here, it is equal to 0.2. Another parameter is the random state, which is the seed generator used to make the random split. It ensures that every time you perform the train-test split on the same data, you will get the same instances in each set. We can also specify the stratify argument. If we want to ensure that the train and test set have similar proportions of both classes, we can do that by specifying stratify to be equal to y.\n",

    "Let's revisit our logistic regression example, executed after a train-test split. We create the LogisticRegression object and fit it on the training set. We can calculate the accuracy on the training data, calling score on the logistic regression with arguments X_train and y_train. We can also calculate the accuracy score of the model using the test set - X_test and y_test. It is slightly lower than the accuracy on the training data, which is usually the case.\n",

    "\n",
    "02:32 - 02:59\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that another way to calculate the accuracy was to use the accuracy_score function from the sklearn.metrics. After we have built the logistic regression model, we apply predict to the logistic regression specifying X_test as an argument. In the last step, we call the accuracy score on the true and predicted labels. The value is identical to the accuracy produced by the score function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The accuracy is a useful measure of a model's performance but it's not always the most informative. We can instead use something called a 'confusion matrix'. It shows the number of predicted and true values of each of the classes, as displayed in the table. A confusion matrix will allow us to calculate the values in each cell and say how many observations of each class we have predicted correctly. For more details of when we would want to optimize for the different cells, refer to other DataCamp courses.\n",
