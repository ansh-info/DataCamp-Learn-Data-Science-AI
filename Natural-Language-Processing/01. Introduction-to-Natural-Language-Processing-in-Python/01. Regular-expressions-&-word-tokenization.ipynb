    "Natural language processing is a massive field of study and actively used practice which aims to make sense of language using statistics and computers. In this course, you will learn some of the basics of NLP which will help you move from simple to more difficult and advanced topics. Even though this is the first course, you will still get some exposure to the challenges of the field such as topic identification and text classification. Some interesting NLP areas you might have heard about are: topic identification, chatbots, text classification, translation, sentiment analysis. There are also many more! You will learn the fundamentals of some of these topics as we move through the course.\n",

    "00:47 - 01:54\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are strings you can use that have a special syntax, which allows you to match patterns and find other strings. A pattern is a series of letters or symbols which can map to an actual text or words or punctuation. You can use regular expressions to do things like find links in a webpage, parse email addresses and remove unwanted strings or characters. Regular expressions are often referred to as regex and can be used easily with python via the `re` library. Here we have a simple import of the library. We can match a substring by using the re.match method which matches a pattern with a string. It takes the pattern as the first argument, the string as the second and returns a match object, here we see it matched exactly what we expected: abc. We can also use special patterns that regex understands, like the \\w+ which will match a word. We can see here via the match object representation that it has matched the first word it found -- hi.\n",

    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:54 - 02:10\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of characters and patterns you can learn and memorize with regular expressions, but to get started, I want to share a few common patterns. The first pattern \\w we already saw, it is used to match words. The \\d pattern allows us to match digits, which can be useful when you need to find them and separate them in a string. The \\s pattern matches spaces, the period is a wildcard character. The wildcard will match ANY letter or symbol. The + and * characters allow things to become greedy, grabbing repeats of single letters or whole patterns. For example to match a full word rather than one character, we need to add the + symbol after the \\w. Using these character classes as capital letters negates them so the \\S matches anything that is not a space. You can also create a group of characters you want by putting them inside square brackets, like our lowercase group.\n",

    "In the following exercises, you'll use the `re` module to perform some simple activities, like splitting on a pattern or finding all patterns in a string. In addition to split and findall, search and match are also quite popular. You saw a simple match at the beginning of this video, and search is similar but doesn't require you to match the pattern from the beginning of the string. The syntax for the regex library is always to pass the pattern first, and the string second. Depending on the method, it may return an iterator, a new string or a match object. Here we see the re.split method will take a pattern for spaces and a string with some spaces and return a list object with the results of splitting on spaces. This can be used for tokenization, so you can preprocess text using regex while doing natural language processing.\n",

    "Tokenization is the process of transforming a string or document into smaller chunks, which we call tokens. This is usually one step in the process of preparing a text for natural language processing. There are many different theories and rules regarding tokenization, and you can create your own tokenization rules using regular expresssions, but normally tokenization will do things like break out words or sentences, often separate punctuation or you can even just tokenize parts of a string like separating all hashtags in a Tweet.\n",

Here is a short example of using the word_tokenize method to break down a string into tokens. We can see from the result that words are separated and punctuation are individual tokens as well.\n",

    "4\\. Why tokenize?\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:58 - 01:31\n",
    "\n",
    "Why bother with tokenization? Because it can help us with some simple text processing tasks like mapping part of speech, matching common words and perhaps removing unwanted tokens like common words or repeated words. Here, we have a good example. The sentence is: I don't like Sam's shoes. When we tokenize it we can clearly see the negation in the not and we can see possession with the 's. These indicators can help us determine meaning from simple text.\n",

    "Beyond just tokenizing words, NLTK has plenty of other tokenizers you can use, including these ones you'll be working with in this chapter. The sent_tokenize function will split a document into individual sentences. The regexp_tokenize uses regular expressions to tokenize the string, giving you more granular control over the process. And the tweettokenizer does neat things like recognize hashtags, mentions and when you have too many punctuation symbols following a sentence. How convenient!!!\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll be using more regex in this section as well, not only when you are tokenizing, but also figuring out how to parse tokens and text. Using the regex module's re.match and re.search are pretty essential tools for Python string processing. Learning when to use search versus match can be challenging, so let's take a look at how they are different. When we use search and match with the same pattern and string with the pattern is at the beginning of the string, we see we find identical matches. That is the case with matching and searching abcde with the pattern abc. When we use search for a pattern that appears later in the string we get a result, but we don't get the same result using match. This is because match will try and match a string from the beginning until it cannot match any longer. Search will go through the ENTIRE string to look for match options. If you need to find a pattern that might not be at the beginning of the string, you should use search. If you want to be specific about the composition of the entire string, or at least the initial pattern, then you should use match.\n",

    "One new regex pattern you will find useful for advanced tokenization is the ability to use the or method. In regex, OR is represented by the pipe character. To use the or, you can define a group using parenthesis. Groups can be either a pattern or a set of characters you want to match. You can also define explicit character classes using square brackets. We'll go a bit more into depth on groups and ranges soon. Let's take an example that we want to tokenize using regular expressions and we want to find all digits and words. We define our pattern using a group with the OR symbol and make them greedy so they catch the full word or digits. Then, we can call findall using Python's re library and return our tokens. Notice that our pattern does not match punctuation but properly matches the words and digits.\n",

    "Let's take a look at another more advanced topic, defining groups and character ranges. Here we have another chart of patterns, and this time we are using ranges or character classes marked by the square brackets and groups marked by the parentheses. We can see in this chart that we can use square brackets to define a new character class. For example, we can match all upper and lowercase english letters using Uppercase A hyphen Uppercase Z which will match all uppercase and then lowercase a hyphen lowercase z which will match all lowercase letters. We can also make ranges to match all digits 0 hyphen 9, or perhaps a more complex range like uppercase and lowercase English with the hyphen and period. Because the hyphen and period are special characters in regex, we must tell regex we mean an ACTUAL period or hyphen. To do so, we use what is called an escape character and in regex that means to place a backwards slash in front of our character so it knows then to look for a hyphen or period. On the other hand, with groups which are designated by the parentheses, we can only match what we explicitly define in the group. So a-z matched only a, a hyphen and z. Groups are useful when you want to define an explicit group, such as the final example; where we are taking spaces or commas.\n",

    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:07\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi everyone! In this video, we are going to learn about using charts with our NLP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Getting started with matplotlib\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:07 - 00:30\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a charting library used by many different open-source Python projects to create data visualizations, charts and graphs. It has fairly straightforward functionality with lots of options for graphs like histograms, bar charts, line charts and scatter plots. It even has advanced functionality like generating 3D graphs and animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Plotting a histogram with matplotlib\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:30 - 01:00\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is usually imported by simply aliasing the pyplot module as plt. If we want to plot a basic histogram, which is a type of plot used to show distribution of data, we can pass in a small array to the `hist` function. The array has 5 appearing twice and 7 appearing three times, so it's a good candidate to show distribution. Finally, we call the plt.show function and matplotlib will show us the generated chart in our system's standard graphics viewing tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Generated histogram\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:00 - 01:29\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the chart that we generated using the previous code. We notice that indeed it has determined proper bins for each entry and we can see that the 7 and 5 bins reflect the distribution we expected to see. It's not the prettiest chart by default, but making it look nicer is fairly easy with more arguments and several available helper libraries.\n",

    "5\\. Combining NLP data extraction with plotting\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:29 - 02:27\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use skills we have learned throughout this first chapter to tokenize text and chart word length for a simple sentence. First, we perform the necessary imports to use NLTK for word tokenization and matplotlib charting. Then, we tokenize the words and punctuation in a short sentence. Finally, we can use Python list comprehension with our tokenized words array to transform it to a list of lengths. As a brief refresher on list comprehensions, it is a succint way to write a for loop. If we look at the syntax, we have opening and closing square brackets. Then we can iterate over any list and make a new list using this simple syntax. Here, we create a list that holds the lengths of each word in the words array simply by saying len(w) for w in words. This will iterate over each word, calculate the length and return it as a new list. We then pass this array of token lengths to the hist function and generate our chart using the plt.show method.\n",

    "6\\. Word length histogram\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:27 - 02:48\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the generated histogram from our previous code. We can see from the chart that we have a majority of four-letter words in our example sentence. Of course, with a simple sentence, this is easy enough to simply count by hand -- but for an entire play or book, this would be tedious and prone to error -- so writing it in code makes it a lot easier.\n",
