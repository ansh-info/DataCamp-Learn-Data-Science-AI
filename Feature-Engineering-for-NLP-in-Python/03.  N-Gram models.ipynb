The strip_accents argument can convert accented characters according to unicode or ASCII mapping. Passing in a stopwords argument will lead to CountVectorizer ignoring stopwords. You can pass in a custom list or the string 'english' to use scikit-learn's list of English stopwords. You can specify tokenization using a regular expression as the value of the token_pattern argument. Tokenization can also be specified using a tokenizer argument. Here, you can pass a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a list of tokens. This way, CountVectorizer allows usage of spaCy's tokenization techniques.

And here in lies the biggest shortcoming of the bag-of-words model: context of the words is lost. In this example, the position of the word 'not' changes the entire sentiment of the review. Therefore, in this lesson, we will study techniques that will allow us to model this.\n",

We've already seen that the BoW vectors run into thousands of dimensions. Adding higher order n-grams increases the number of dimensions even more and while performing machine learning, leads to a problem known as the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, n-grams for n greater than 3 become exceedingly rare to find in multiple documents. So that feature becomes effectively useless. For these reasons, it is often a good idea to restrict yourself to n-grams where n is small.\n",
