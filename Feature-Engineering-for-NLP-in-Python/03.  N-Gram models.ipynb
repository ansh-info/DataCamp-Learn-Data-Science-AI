For instance, the second dimension will correspond to the number of times the second word in the vocabulary, an, occurs in the document. Let's now convert our documents into word vectors using this bag of words model. The lion is the king of the jungle is converted to the following vector.

We would also want to remove punctuations and stopwords as they are extremely common and don't really contribute much to the character of the document.

    "We import the CountVectorizer class from sklearn.feature_extraction.text. This is the class that will help us build our bag of words model. Next, we instantiate a CountVectorizer object vectorizer. We finally create our matrix of word vectors by passing corpus to the fit_transform method of vectorizer. This is stored in bow_matrix. This bow_matrix is a sparse matrix and we can print out its 2D array form using bow matrix dot toarray(). This gives us the following output. Notice how this is different from the word vectors we generated. This is because CountVectorizer automatically lowercases words and ignores single character tokens such as 'a'. Also, it doesn't necessarily index the vocabulary in alphabetical order. We will learn how to map the vocabulary to the indices in the exercises. We can now use this bow_matrix as our training features in ML models.\n",
