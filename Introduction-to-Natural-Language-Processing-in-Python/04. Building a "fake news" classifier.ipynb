    "Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where you are given or create training data. This data has a label or outcome which you want the model or algorithm to learn. One common problem used as a good example of introductory machine learning is the Fischer's iris data; we have a few example rows of it here. The data has several features: Sepal Length and width and Petal length and width. The label we want to learn and predict is the species. This is a classification problem, so you want to be able to classify or categorize some data based on what you already know or have learned. Our goal is to use the dataset to make intelligent hypotheses about the species based on the geometric features.\n",

To begin, we collect and preprocess our data. Then, we determine a label - this is what we want the model to learn, in our case, the genre of the movie. We can split our data into training and testing datasets, keeping them separate so we can build our model using only the training data. The test data remains unseen so we can test how well our model performs after it is trained. This is an essential part of Supervised Learning! We also need to extract features from the text to predict the label. We will use a bagof words vectorizer built into scikit-learn to do so. After the model is trained, we can then test it using the test dataset. There are also other methods to evaluate model performance, such as k-fold cross validation and you can check out DataCamp's Machine Learning curriculum to learn that and more!\n",

    "To do so, we first need to import some necessary tools from Sci-kit learn. Once the data is loaded, we can create y which traditionally refers to the labels or outcome you want the model to learn. We can use the Sci-Fi column which has 1 if the movie is Sci-Fi and 0 if it is Action. Then, scikit learn's train_test_split function can be used to split the dataframe into training and testing data. This method will split the features which is the plot summary or column PLOT and the labels (y) based on a given test_size such as 0.33, representing 33 percent. I have also set random state so we have a repeatable result, it operates similar to setting a random seed and ensures I get the same results when I run the code again. The function will take 33% of rows to be marked as test data, and remove them from the training data. The test data is later used to see what my model has learned. The resulting data from train_test_split are training data (as X_train) and training labels (as y_train) and testing data as X_test and testing labels as y_test. Next, we create a countvectorizer which turns my text into bag of words vectors similar to a Gensim corpus, it will also remove English stop words from the movie plot summaries as a preprocessing step. Each token now acts as a feature for the machine learning classification problem, just like the flower measurements in the iris data set. We can then call fit_transform on the training data to create the bag-of-words vectors. Fit_transform is a handy shortcut which will call the model's fit and then transform methods; which here generates a mapping of words with IDs and vectors representing how many times each word appears in the plot. Fit_transform operates differently for each model, but generally fit will find parameters or norms in the data and transform will apply the model's underlying algorithm or approximation -- similar to preprocessing but with a specific use case in mind. For the CountVectorizer class, fit_transform will create the bagofwords dictionary and vectors for each document using the training data. After calling fit_transform on the training data, we call transform on the test data to create bag of words vectors using the same dictionary. The training and test vectors need to use a consistent set of words, so the trained model can understand the test input. If we don't have much data, there can be an issue with words in the test set which don't appear in the training data. This will throw an error, so you will need to either add more training data or remove the unknown words from the test dataset. In only a few lines of Python, we have transformed text into bagofwords vectors and generated test and training datasets. Scikitlearn is a great aid in helping make NLP machine learning simple and accessible.\n",

And given a Spaceship and an alien how likely NOW is it a sci-fi movie? Each word acts as a feature from our CountVectorizer helping classify our text using probability. Naive bayes has been used for text classification problems since the 1960s and continues to be used today despite the growth of many other models, algorithms and neural network architectures.

    "We'll use scikit learn's naive bayes to take a look at our scifi versus action plot classification problem. Recall the data we're using is simply IMDB plot summaries, and whether the movie is science fiction or action. First, we import the naive bayes model class, multinomial naive bayes, which works well with count vectorizers as it expects integer inputs. MultinomialNB is also used for multiple label classification. This model may not work as well with floats, such as tfidf weighted inputs. Instead, use support vector machines or even linear models; although I recommend trying Naive Bayes first to determine if it can also work well. We use the metrics module to evaluate model performance. We initialize our class and call fit with the training data. If you recall from the previous video, this will determine the internal parameters based on the dataset. We pass the training count vectorizer first and the training labels second. After fitting the model, we call predict with the count vectorizer test data. Predict will use the trained model to predict the label based on the test data vectors. We save the predicted labels in variable pred to test the accuracy. Finally, we test accuracy using accuracy_score from the metrics module and passing the predicted and test labels. Accuracy for our model means the percentage of correct genre guesses out of total guesses. Our model has about 86% accuracy -- which is pretty good for a first try!

    "To further evaluate our model, we can also check the confusion matrix which shows correct and incorrect labels. The confusion_matrix function from the metrics module takes the test labels, the predictions and a list of labels. If the label list is not passed, scikit learn will order them using Python ordering. The confusion matrix is a bit easier to read when we transform it into a table. The first value and last value of the matrix (or the main diagonal of the matrix) show true scores, meaning, true classification of both action and scifi films based on the plot bag of words vectors. In a confusion matrix, the predicted labels are shown across the top and the true labels are shown down the side. This confusion matrix shows 864 Sci-Fi movies incorrectly labeled as Action and 563 Action movies incorrectly labeled as Sci-Fi. We can see from the distribution of true positives and negatives that our dataset is a bit skewed, we have many more action films than sci-fi. This could be one reason that our action movies are predicted more accurately.\n",

    "Sentiment analysis is far from a solved problem.

There is also active research regarding how separate communities use the same words differently. This is a graphic from a project called Social Sent created by a group of researchers at Stanford. The project compares sentiment changes in words over time and from different communities. Here, the authors compare sentiment in word usage between two different reddit communities, 2X which is a woman-centered reddit and sports. The graphic illustrates the SAME word can be used with very different sentiments depending on the communal understanding of the word.\n",
