    "\n",
    "00:12 - 00:59\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the chances of an event using probability. We can calculate the probability of some event by taking the number of ways the event can happen and dividing it by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if we flip a coin, it can land on either heads or tails. To get the probability of the coin landing on heads, we divide the 1 way to get heads by the two possible outcomes, heads and tails. This gives us one half, or a fifty percent chance of getting heads. Probability is always between zero and 100 percent. If the probability of something is zero, it's impossible, and if the probability of something is 100%, it will certainly happen.\n",
