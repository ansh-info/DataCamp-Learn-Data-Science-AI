    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:12 - 00:59\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the chances of an event using probability. We can calculate the probability of some event by taking the number of ways the event can happen and dividing it by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if we flip a coin, it can land on either heads or tails. To get the probability of the coin landing on heads, we divide the 1 way to get heads by the two possible outcomes, heads and tails. This gives us one half, or a fifty percent chance of getting heads. Probability is always between zero and 100 percent. If the probability of something is zero, it's impossible, and if the probability of something is 100%, it will certainly happen.\n",

    "We can recreate this scenario in Python using the sample() method. By default, it randomly samples one row from the DataFrame. However, if we run the same thing again, we may get a different row since the sample method chooses randomly. If we want to show the team how we picked Brian, this won't work well.\n",

    "\n",
    "01:45 - 02:24\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we get the same results when we run the script in front of the team, we'll set the random seed using np-dot-random-dot-seed. The seed is a number that Python's random number generator uses as a starting point, so if we orient it with a seed number, it will generate the same random value each time. The number itself doesn't matter. We could use 5, 139, or 3 million. The only thing that matters is that we use the same seed the next time we run the script. Now, we, or one of the sales-team members, can run this code over and over and get Brian every time.\n",

Brian has already been picked and he can't be in two meetings at once, so we'll pick between the remaining three. This is called sampling without replacement, since we aren't replacing the name we already pulled out.\n",
