    "1\\. The normal distribution\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:18\n",
    "\n",
    "The next probability distribution we'll discuss is the normal distribution. It's one of the most important probability distributions you'll learn about since a countless number of statistical methods rely on it, and it applies to more real-world situations than the distributions we've covered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. What is the normal distribution?\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:18 - 00:29\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution looks like this. Its shape is commonly referred to as a \"bell curve\". The normal distribution has a few important properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Symmetrical\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:29 - 00:35\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's symmetrical, so the left side is a mirror image of the right.\n",

    "4\\. Area = 1\n",
    "------------\n",

    "00:35 - 00:41\n",

    "Second, just like any continuous distribution, the area beneath the curve is 1.\n",

    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:41 - 00:54\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the probability never hits 0, even if it looks like it does at the tail ends. Only 0-point-006% of its area is contained beyond the edges of this graph.\n",

    "6\\. Described by mean and standard deviation\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:54 - 01:24\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is described by its mean and standard deviation. Here is a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and standard deviation of 3, and here is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. When a normal distribution has mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1, it's a special distribution called the standard normal distribution Notice how both distributions have the same shape,\n",

    "---------------------------------------\n",

    "01:27 - 01:34\n",

    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:51 - 02:11\n",
    "\n",
    "There's lots of real-world data shaped like the normal distribution. For example, here is a histogram of the heights of women that participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The mean height is around 161 centimeters and the standard deviation is about 7 centimeters.\n",

    "12\\. Approximating data with the normal distribution\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:11 - 02:26\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this height data closely resembles the normal distribution, we can take the area under a normal distribution with mean 161 and standard deviation 7 to approximate what percent of women fall into different height ranges.\n",

    "13\\. What percent of women are shorter than 154 cm?\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:26 - 02:56\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what percent of women are shorter than 154 centimeters? We can answer this using norm-dot-cdf from scipy-dot-stats, which takes the area of the normal distribution less than some number. We pass in the number of interest, 154, followed by the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution we're using. This gives us about 16% of women are shorter than 154 centimeters.\n",

    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:09 - 03:19\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the percent of women between 154 and 157 centimeters tall we can take the area below 157 and subtract the area below 154,\n",

    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:19 - 03:25\n",

    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:25 - 03:48\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also calculate percentages from heights using norm-dot-ppf. To figure out what height 90% of women are shorter than, we pass 0-point-9 into norm-dot-ppf along with the same mean and standard deviation we've been working with. This tells us that 90% of women are shorter than 170 centimeters tall.\n",

    "18\\. What height are 90% of women taller than?\n",
    "----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:48 - 04:06\n",
    "\n",
    "We can figure out the height 90% of women are taller than, since this is also the height that 10% of women are shorter than. We can take 1 minus point-9 to get point-1, which we'll use as the first argument of norm-ppf.\n",

    "19\\. Generating random numbers\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "04:06 - 04:24\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with other distributions, we can generate random numbers from a normal distribution using norm-dot-rvs, passing in the distribution's mean and standard deviation, as well as the sample size we want. Here, we've generated 10 more random heights.\n",

    "This phenomenon is known as the central limit theorem, which states that a sampling distribution will approach a normal distribution as the number of trials increases. In our example, the sampling distribution became closer to the normal distribution as we took more and more sample means. It's important to note that the central limit theorem only applies when samples are taken randomly and are independent, for example, randomly picking sales deals with replacement.\n",

    "The central limit theorem, or CLT, applies to other summary statistics as well. If we take the standard deviation of 5 rolls 1000 times, the sample standard deviations are distributed normally, centered around 1-point-9, which is the distribution's standard deviation.\n",

    "Another statistic that the CLT applies to is proportion. Let's sample from the sales team 10 times with replacement and see how many draws have Claire as the outcome. In this case, 10% of draws were Claire. If we draw again, there are 40% Claires.\n",

    "02:54 - 03:07\n",
    "\n",
    "If we repeat this 1000 times and plot the distribution of the sample proportions, it resembles a normal distribution centered around 0-point-25, since Claire's name was on 25% of the tickets.\n",

    "----------------------------------\n",

    "Since these sampling distributions are normal, we can take their mean to get an estimate of a distribution's mean, standard deviation, or proportion. If we take the mean of our sample means from earlier, we get 3-point-48. That's pretty close to the expected value, which is 3-point-5! Similarly, the mean of the sample proportions of Claires isn't far off from 0-point-25. In these examples, we know what the underlying distributions look like, but if we don't, this can be a useful method for estimating characteristics of an underlying distribution. The central limit theorem also comes in handy when you have a huge population and don't have the time or resources to collect data on everyone. Instead, you can collect several smaller samples and create a sampling distribution to estimate what the mean or standard deviation is.\n",
