    "Prompt engineering is the practice of optimizing a prompt to get the best response from language models like ChatGPT. Today, we'll begin our journey of mastering prompt engineering with the help of an ex-FBI negotiator combined with ChatGPT in a real-time interactive scenario so that the next time you negotiate a raise, you're armed with the tools to succeed.\n",

    "When I think of negotiation, one person comes to mind: Chris Voss. He's not your average negotiator. Drawing from his rich experience as an FBI hostage negotiator, he wrote \"Never Split the Difference,\" a field manual for high-stakes negotiations. The techniques inside the book, crafted for critical scenarios, are invaluable for everyday situations. We're taking a unique approach by simulating a negotiation with ChatGPT. For each step, you'll use Voss's techniques to conquer the negotiation for your next pay rise. Let's see what this prompt structure looks like.\n",

    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",

    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:23 - 01:48\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, structured Input and output. Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a markup language designed for storing and transporting data. When used in prompts for LLMs, XML tags can help define a clear, structured format for both input and output. This structure can enable more precise and systematic data extraction, interpretation, and generation.\n",

    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:48 - 02:02\n",

    "8\\. XML tags - Facilitating complex interactions\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:02 - 02:16\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where complex data interactions are necessary (such as in our negotiation example, where we work through multi-step reasoning), tags can mark different steps, making it easier for the model to follow the required logic and sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "02:08 - 02:34\n",
    "\n",
    "How does ChatGPT control the length and output format of our response? We direct this through specifications. We also want to infuse Hemingway's focus on action and dialogue to create clear, impactful, and succinct content that engages readers without unnecessary wording. You can adjust these specifications according to the context of your writing, whether it be an email, a social media post, or even a short story for a friend.\n",

    "Now, it's time to give ChatGPT an example to fine-tune its response. The example we provide ChatGPT doesn't have to match the topic we want to write about, but it gives ChatGPT the framework to build its response from. This is called one-shot prompting. We're providing a model answer for ChatGPT to replicate. It's a bit like seeing the answers to a test and knowing how to meet the criteria.\n",
