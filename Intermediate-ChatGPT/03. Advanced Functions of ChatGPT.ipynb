    "00:27 - 00:37\n",

    "For this final lesson, let's consider the big picture of ChatGPT. Generative AI caught mainstream attention with ChatGPT's launch in November 2022.\n",

    "8\\. Three key ideas\n",

    "\n",
    "00:37 - 00:48\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Why ChatGPT makes mistakes 2. How ChatGPT thinks 3. Where ChatGPT is heading\n",
    "\n",
    "9\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes\n",
    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:48 - 00:51\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explored in \"Understanding Prompt Engineering\"\n",
    "\n",
    "10\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes - Reversal curse\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:51 - 00:58\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's knowledge base is imperfect and often quite strange. This is best highlighted by the reversal curse.\n",
    "\n",
    "11\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes - Reversal curse\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "00:58 - 01:05\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask GPT-3.5, \"Who is Tom Cruise's mother?\" It says Mary Lee Pfeiffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "12\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes - Reversal curse\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:05 - 01:12\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you start a new conversation and ask, \"Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?\" It says Jeff Bezos! How strange.\n",
    "\n",
    "13\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes - Reversal curse\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:12 - 01:21\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's knowledge is often quite one-dimensional. You need to ask questions from certain angles for accurate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "14\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:21 - 01:45\n",
    "\n",
    "What about OpenAI's GPT-4o model? Let's ask, \"How many words are in your response to this prompt?\" It states, \"There are 41 words in my response to this prompt\". This is a prime example of hallucination where ChatGPT confidently states a wrong answer. ChatGPT wasn't trained to understand 'words' like humans. Instead, it focuses on language at the token level.\n",
    "\n",
    "15\\. Idea 1: Why ChatGPT makes mistakes\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:45 - 01:52\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the takeaway? To uncover the truth, we've got to understand how ChatGPT thinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "16\\. Idea 2: How ChatGPT thinks\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "01:52 - 02:03\n",
    "\n",
    "We must remember ChatGPT's function. ChatGPT predicts the next word based on the previous sequence. It's a next-word prediction tool, trained to be conversational.\n",
    "\n",
    "17\\. Idea 2: How ChatGPT thinks\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:03 - 02:23\n",
    "\n",
    "System 1 versus System 2 thinking was popularised by the book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman. System 1 thinking is fast, instinctive, and automatic, whereas system 2 thinking is slow, rational and conscious.\n",
    "\n",
    "18\\. Idea 2: How ChatGPT thinks\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:23 - 02:36\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this relevant to how ChatGPT thinks? Well, LLMs today are only capable of System 1 thinking, imitating human responses. It's hard to go above human response accuracy if LLMs are only trained on humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "19\\. Idea 2: How ChatGPT thinks\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:36 - 02:50\n",
    "\n",
    "Models generate words like laying train tracks in front of them. What could it mean to give language models System 2 thinking? This remains a future development I'm excited about and sparks thoughts about where ChatGPT might be heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "20\\. Idea 3: Where ChatGPT is heading\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "02:50 - 03:11\n",
    "\n",
    "In May 2024, OpenAI partnered with Be My Eyes, aiding people with blindness through GPT-4o's multimodality. As the AI sees through the camera and speaks, Andy builds a visual image and can fully appreciate what's in front of him. This is the next level up from traditional LLMs, which just process text.\n",
    "\n",
    "21\\. Idea 3: Where ChatGPT is heading\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:11 - 03:29\n",
    "\n",
    "The example with Be My Eyes is a spectacular and very real step towards a much more natural human-computer interface. ChatGPT will soon be integrated into our phones, computers, and, at some point, with the recent advancements of brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink, our minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "22\\. Idea 3: Where ChatGPT is heading\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:29 - 03:49\n",
    "\n",
    "Extrapolating ChatGPT's progress forward means we must respect the outcome that hovers over our shoulders when we eventually reach artificial general intelligence---a system capable of producing the same output as a human knowledge worker. There are three key questions that are important for humanity to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "23\\. Idea 3: Where ChatGPT is heading\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "03:49 - 04:05\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we share wealth? How does access to these systems work? Who decides what we get to use these systems for? How we think about a world like this is not yet obvious. Answering these questions will define humanity in the years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "24\\. Congratulations!\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "04:05 - 04:16\n",
